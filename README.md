Technical challenge

To start record you should press the floating button on the bottom with a play icon
To list journeys you should press the floating button with info icon

When app is in Show jorney path mode you will see a journey date and time details on panel on top of the map. App move camera on the 
path journey. If you want to return to see user movements real time you should press "Return" button.

****** DISCLOSURE ************************************************
I made a mistake in reading point 8 on the "Primary goals" :

"The app should record the user’s location in the background if the user selects “tracking on” and closes the UI."

So I understand that app should background itself when record button is pressed. I just commented superfluos part so you can see what I did
and I made a new commit
